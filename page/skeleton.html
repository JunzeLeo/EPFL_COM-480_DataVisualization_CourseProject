<h2> Background </h2>
<p class="width-limited">
	Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, the average
	temperature of the Earth has increased more than 1.0 Celsius. However, in
	recent years, global warming and climate change have been the subject of a
	great deal of political controversy, especially in the U.S.. The U.S. president,
	Donald Trump, has criticized in his twitter that the global warming is "a hoax",
	 "fictional", and even "bullshit".
</p>
<p class="width-limited">
	While the world is overwhelmed with the COVID-19 pandemic, the earth is still
	warming and many lives are suffering from the heating planet. A recent news
	reports that Antarctica has hit the highest temperature on record of 18.3C in
	February 2020. The climate zone for lives now is shrinking.
</p>
<p class="width-limited">
	Is global warming real? What are its causes and consequences? Especially, what
	are the impacts on lives?

				</p>
				<p>
					The top-left figure dynamically shows geological view of the annually
					regional average temperature year by year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the bottom-left
					draws the average annual global temperatures of the corresponding year
				  and the regression curve.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this way, we could visually show the fact that the global warming is
					not a “bullshit”. Besides, we could visually show the increase of temperature
					of each region of the world. The domain knowledge is to help our audiences
					to better understand why global warming is indeed a challenge to lifes.

		Visualization Design:
	</p>
	<p>
		The top-left figure shows the evolution of urbanization level, annual temperature
	  and forest coverage of countries verses time, i.e. the dots would move in the
		figure year by year.

	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the trend visualization, every dot is Interactive. Clicking a
		dot(country/region) would draw 3 line chart on the left: temperature, urbanization,
		forest coverage v.s. time, so that users could directly see the numerical relations
		between them. As long as time is sufficient, we would implement a fisheye distortion
		 to the scatter plot so that users could have a better view of clustered dots.
