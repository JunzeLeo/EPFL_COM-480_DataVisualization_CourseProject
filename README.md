[Earth Surface Temperature:](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) This dataset contains land and ocean temperature since 1750 by different scales (eg. country, state, major city etc).

[Impact of Countries on Global Warming:](https://www.kaggle.com/catamount11/who-is-resposible-for-global-warming) This dataset contains the amount of CO2 emissions of each country from 1960 to 2018 and some meta data of each country (eg. location, income etc).

[Global Food & Agriculture Statistics:](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-food-agriculture-statistics) This dataset contains agriculture data (eg. crops, fertilizer, forest, land etc.) for 200 countries and more than 200 primary products.

[Urbanization:](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization) This dataset contains urbanization related data of each country, for example, share of populations living in urban areas, GDP per capita and employment in agriculture.

[Deforestation:](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/annual-deforestation-change) This dataset contains data about natural forest area to other uses, including shifting cultivation, permanent agriculture, ranching, settlements, and infrastructure development.

[Threatened species](https://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=WILD_LIFE&lang=en) This dataset contains information about number of dangerous species in danger per


### 2.2 Problematic

#### Background
Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th centry, the average temperatry of the Earth has [increased more than 1.0 Celsius](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php). However, in recent years, global warming and climate change have been the subject of a great deal of political controversy, especially in the U.S. The U.S. president, Trump, has critisizes in his twitter that the global warming is "[a hoax](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/427226424987385856)", "[fictional](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/509436043368873984)", and even "[bullshit](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/418542137899491328)". 

Is global warming real? What are its causes and consequences? Especially, **what are the impacts on lives?**

#### Motivation
<!-- 
1. What am I trying to show with my VIZ
2. overview for the project, motivation, target audience.
 -->

While the world is overwhelmed with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Earth is still warming and many lifes are suffering from the heating planet. A recent news reports that the anarctica has hitted the highest temperature on record of 18.3C in February 2020. Climate zone for lifes now is shrinking.

To keep within the climate zone for survival, most species on this planet, including plants, will have to migrate[](https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/wildlife/problems/climate_change/). However, many species will not be able to redistribute themselves fast enough, i.e. these species may well become extinct. 

Human beings are no exception. Global warming could lead to extrem climates and wethers, such as ozone depletion, El Niño, increased danger of wildland fires, global spread of infectious diseases, drought and flood, which would seriously affect food-producing system and humanitariarism.

In this project, we would like to visualize the reasons for global warming and its effects to species and human beings so that to appeal more concern from general public to this global challenge.
